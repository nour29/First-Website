# First-Website
Web Programming Techniques assessed my capability in creating a simple website using PHP
# Description 
Mr Mohamed Vandy lectured how to create a website using HTML, CSS and PHP files then he demonstrated how to make the whole website into PHP files. The class mostly ignored styling (Cascade Style Sheet) and rather focused on the database implementation.
# Instruction
The project can be run on a computer with an Apache Server, like XAMPP. Add the files to a folder in htdocs, start the server for Apache and MySQL, open the browser and navigate to  http://localhost/phpmyadmin/ .
